 A simple extension for GNOME Shell 3.26+ that adds an icon representing the current weather condition and the current actual temperature to the clock in the panel.

GNOME Weather is required.

## Why GNOME Shell 3.26+?
This extension uses native JavaScript(ES6) features incompatible with GNOME Shell < 3.26.
